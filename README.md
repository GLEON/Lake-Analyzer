Lake Analyzer
====

Lake Analyzer is a MATLAB code package for calculating physical indices of water column stability from temperature and (if applicable) wind measurements. The package has a user manual and a publication: Read JS, DP Hamilton, ID Jones, K Muraoka, LA Winslow, R Kroiss, CH Wu, E Gaiser. 2011. Derivation of lake mixing and stratification indices from high-resolution lake buoy data. Environmental Modelling and Software. 26: 1325-1336.

Users of the code base are encouraged to fork this code, modify it, and send a pull request to integrate changes made to the algorithms. 

Lake Analyzer is in active development, and we are hoping to add flux estimates to the code, including evaporation and the gas transfer velocity. At this point, the MATLAB Lake Analyzer code and web portal (see below) will continue to focus on physical derivatives.
